CORE:
1. When no tag detection & no lidar detector --> don't create publishers
2. OMP for util functions
3. Composable nodes
4. Nit-picky:
    a. TraversibilityResources uses MappingPointCloudType::Ptr but doesn't need to be shared
    a. Use std::vector<..., eigen_aligned_alloc<...>> instead of pcl::PointCloud<...> for buffers

ODOMETRY:
1. Flakiness on initialization (sitting at origin)?

KFC MAP:
1. Frustum radius/radial distance scale inversely proportionally to base_link velocity
|-> A. Sparse point removal of ghost points if this doesn't work
2. More parallelization
3. Range limits (octree leaf reassignment?)

TESTING:
1. Find optimal threading for nanogicp
